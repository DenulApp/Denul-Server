pyVICBF
=======

This folder contains a copy of the [pyVICBF](https://github.com/malexmave/pyvicbf) repository, as the library has not yet been converted into a python package.

I'd like to have included the code as a git submodule, but appearently it is impossible to include subdirectories of other repositories as submodules :(.

Information about the library, including the license, can be found in its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/malexmave/pyvicbf).
